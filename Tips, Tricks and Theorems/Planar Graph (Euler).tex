Euler's formula states that if a finite, connected, planar graph is drawn in the plane without any edge intersections, and $v$ is the number of vertices, $e$ is the number of edges and $f$ is the number of faces (regions bounded by edges, including the outer, infinitely large region), then:

$$ f + v = e + 2$$


It can be extended to non connected planar graphs with $c$ connected components:

$$ f + v = e + c + 1$$
