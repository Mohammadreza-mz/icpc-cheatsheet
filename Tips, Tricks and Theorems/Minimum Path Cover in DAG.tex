Given a directed acyclic graph $G = (V, E)$, we are to find the minimum number
of vertex-disjoint paths to cover each vertex in V.

We can construct a bipartite graph $G' = (Vout \cup Vin, E' )$ from $G$, where : \\

$$ Vout = \{ v \in V : v~has~positive~out-degree \} $$
$$ Vin = \{ v \in V : v~has~positive~in-degree \} $$
$$ E' = \{ (u,v) \in Vout \times Vin : (u,v) \in E \} $$

Then it can be shown, via KÃ¶nig's theorem, that G' has a matching of size m if
and only if there exists $n-m$ vertex-disjoint paths that cover each vertex in G,
where $n$ is the number of vertices in G and $m$ is the maximum cardinality
bipartite mathching in G'. \\

Therefore, the problem can be solved by finding the maximum cardinality matching in G' instead.

\textbf{NOTE:} If the paths are note necesarily disjoints, find the transitive closure
and solve the problem for disjoint paths.
