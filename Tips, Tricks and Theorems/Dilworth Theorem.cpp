Let S be a finite partially ordered set. The size of a maximal antichain equals the size of a minimal chain cover of S. This is called the Dilworthâ€™s theorem.

The width of a finite partially ordered set S is the maximum size of an antichain in S. In other words, the width of a finite partially ordered set S is the minimum number of chains needed to cover S, i.e. the minimum number of chains such that any element of S is in at least one of the chains.

Definition of chain : A chain in a partially ordered set is a subset of elements which are all comparable to each other.
Definition of antichain : An antichain is a subset of elements, no two of which are comparable to each other.
