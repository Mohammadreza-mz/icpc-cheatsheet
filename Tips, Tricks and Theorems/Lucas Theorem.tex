For non-negative integers $m$ and $n$ and a prime $p$, the following congruence relation holds:
:$$\binom{m}{n}\equiv\prod_{i=0}^k\binom{m_i}{n_i}\pmod p,$$
where
:$$m=m_kp^k+m_{k-1}p^{k-1}+\cdots +m_1p+m_0,$$
and
:$$n=n_kp^k+n_{k-1}p^{k-1}+\cdots +n_1p+n_0$$
are the base $p$ expansions of $m$ and $n$ respectively.  This uses the convention that $\tbinom{m}{n} = 0$ if $m \le n$.
